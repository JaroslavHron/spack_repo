    Gmsh is a free 3D finite element grid generator with a built-in CAD engine
    and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and
    user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization
    capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
    post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done
    either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text
    files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
